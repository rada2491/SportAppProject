      "content": "Thibaut Courtois is set for a move from Chelsea to Real Madrid pending a medical, after the clubs announced they had agreed to a deal on Wednesday. According to sources, Real Madrid will pay Chelsea £35 million (€38.8m, $45m) for the Belgium international. The deal will also see midfielder Mateo Kovacic join the Blues on a season-long loan. Chelsea have already moved to replace Courtois, activating the €80m (£71.5m) buyout clause in the contract of Athletic Bilbao goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga, making him the world's most expensive goalkeeper.",

      "content": "Arturo Vidal arrived in Spain on Sunday to pose for photographs for the first time since agreeing to become a Barcelona player.  The Chilean had a big smile across his face as he stuck his thumbs up for the camera, but it's not a signing which has been universally celebrated. Vidal joins Barca from Bayern Munich for around €20 million. If you look it has CV, it looks like a good deal. Some, though, disagree.",

It took just 49 seconds for Costa to rampage his way through the entire Madrid defence and hammer Atletico in front, with the equaliser near the half-hour mark coming when Gareth Bale's superb curling right-footed cross was deftly headed home by Karim Benzema.",

Even so, Barcelona's 3-0 win Wednesday over Boca Juniors provides more evidence toward a clear conclusion: how rich South American football is, and how poor the continent's club game has become.",
